# üåä Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulations üåä

Welcome to my Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) repository! Here, I explored various numerical methods and simulations for solving fundamental fluid dynamics problems. From 1D linear and non-linear convection to extending my understanding to 2D and 3D Burger's equations, I delve into a wide range of CFD scenarios. Additionally, we tackle classic problems like the 2D cavity and Channel Flow using Navier-Stokes and Poisson equations.

## üôè Acknowledgments

Special thanks to my Prof. Dr. Anirudh Kulkarni for organizing the 5-Day skill development workshop on Computational Fluid Dynamics. Your guidance and expertise have been invaluable in shaping my understanding of this complex subject matter.

## ‚ú® Introduction

This repository focuses on solving fundamental fluid dynamics problems using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). FDM is a numerical technique for solving differential equations by approximating them with difference equations, leveraging Taylor series expansions. While it is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness, it is considered an obsolete method in the context of modern CFD, as newer techniques have surpassed it in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
